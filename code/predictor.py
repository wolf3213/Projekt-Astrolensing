            How it works:
            -calculate mean magnitudo, magnitudo standard devaition
            -discard points which are widht*mag_std away from mean magnitudo
            -calculate (weighted) mean time of points which were discarded 
            -calculate time standard deviation (dispersion of discarded points, time-wise)
            -compare calculated values with thresholds:
                ~time_std_min is minimal time dispersion, prevents from returning predicting
                 too fast curve (1-2 days, we know lenses are wider)
                ~time_std_thr is maximal time dispersion, we know lenses are not wider 
                 than about 100-200 days
                ~count_thr is number of discarded points, we want curves that have
                 at least over a dozen points '''

        Idea
        To be close means disctance beetween two times has to be smaller than close_gap.
        Then number of close elements is contained in how_much set.
        It gives positive result when any element of how_much set is bigger than minclose.
        Numbers of positve results is ,,pos''
        Ex. 1,2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14,21,30
        close gap=1.1
        minclose=3
